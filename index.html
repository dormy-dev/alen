    <h1>The dromedary</h1>
    <h2>Incredible animals</h2>
    <div class="flexy">
        <p>The dromedary, also known as the Arabian camel, is a remarkable animal that has perfectly adapted to the
            harsh conditions <br>of the desert. With its single hump, the dromedary stores fat reserves that enable it
            to survive long periods without food and water.<br> These animals are primarily found in the arid and
            semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.

            As herbivores, dromedaries<br> feed on dry grasses, leaves, and shrubs. Their digestive system is highly
            efficient, allowing <br>them to maximize nutrient absorption from the scarce and tough vegetation available
            in their habitat. One of the most striking<br> features of dromedaries is their ability to close their
            nostrils to prevent sand and dust from entering, a crucial adaptation for living in desert environments.<br>

            Throughout history, dromedaries have been invaluable to humans. They have been used as pack animals for
            transporting goods<br> and people across long distances, thanks to their endurance and strength. In addition
            to their utility as transportation, dromedaries provide meat, milk, and hides,<br> making them essential to
            the livelihoods of many desert-dwelling communities.

            Dromedaries are true symbols of resilience and adaptability, able to navigate the <br>challenging desert
            landscapes with grace and strength. Their unique characteristics and historical significance make them
            fascinating creatures to study and admire.</p>
